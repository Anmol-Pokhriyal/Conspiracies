    <h1> Conspiracies</h1>
    </br>
    </br>
    </br>
    <p class="firstpara">Some works, such as the 2014 book <strong>Grey Wolf: The Escape of Adolf Hitler by British authors Simon Dunstan and Gerrard Williams</strong> , and the docudrama film by Williams based on it, suggest that Hitler and Braun
      did not commit suicide, but actually escaped to Argentina. The scenario proposed by these two authors is as follows: a number of U-boats took certain Nazis and Nazi loot to Argentina, where the Nazis were supported by future president Juan
      Perón, who, with his wife "Evita", had been receiving money from the Nazis for some time. Hitler allegedly arrived in Argentina, first staying at Hacienda San Ramón, east of San Carlos de Bariloche. Hitler then moved to a Bavarian-styled
      mansion at Inalco, a remote and barely accessible spot at the northwest end of Lake Nahuel Huapi, close to the Chilean border. Around 1954, Eva Braun left Hitler and moved to Neuquén with their daughter, Ursula ('Uschi'); and Hitler died in
      February 1962.</p>



    <p  class="secondpara">This theory of Hitler's flight to Argentina has been dismissed by historians, including Guy Walters. He has described Dunstan and Williams' theory as "rubbish", adding: "There's no substance to it at all. It
        appeals to the deluded fantasies of conspiracy theorists and has no place whatsoever in historical research."Walters contended that "it is simply impossible to believe that so many people could keep such a grand scale deception so
        quiet," and says that no serious historian would give the story any credibility.Historian Richard J. Evans has many misgiving about the book and subsequent film. For example, he notes that the story about Ursula or 'Uschi' is merely
        "second-hand hearsay evidence without identification or corroboration.
        Evans also notes that Dunstan and Williams made extensive use of a book "Hitler murio en la Argentina" by Manuel Monasterio, which the author later admitted included made up 'strange ramblings', and speculation. Evans contends that Monasterio's book is not to be regarded as a reliable source.In the end, Evans dismisses the survival stories of Hitler as "fantasies""</p>

    <p class="thirdpara">Phillip Citroen's claims
A declassified CIA document dated 3 October 1955 highlights claims made by a self-proclaimed former German SS trooper named Phillip Citroen that Hitler was still alive, and that he "left Colombia for Argentina around January 1955." Enclosed with the document was an alleged photograph of Citroen and a person he claimed to be Hitler; on the back of the photo was written "Adolf Schüttelmayor" and the year 1954. The report also states that neither the contact who reported his conversations with Citroen, nor the CIA station was "in a position to give an intelligent evaluation of the information".[36] The station chief's superiors told him that "enormous efforts could be expended on this matter with remote possibilities of establishing anything concrete", and the investigation was dropped.</p>
